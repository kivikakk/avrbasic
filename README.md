# avrbasic
A BASIC implementation for the ATmega328p.

I'll do a hardware diagram and stuff like that soon.

Parts list:

* ATmega328p
* ST7920, headers, lots of pinâ€“plug header cables
* 100K, 68K, 44K, 20K, 10K, 1K resistors (6 of each)
* 30 tactile switches
* Whatever you use to program and power your AVR
